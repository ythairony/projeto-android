            <h1>Android Mascot History</h1>

            <p>You probably know that the operating system <strong>Android</strong>, maintained by <strong>Google</strong> is one of the most used for mobile devices worldwide. But maybe you don't know that your friendly pet has a name and a very curious story? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>

            <h2>The first version</h2>

            <p>The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer called <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" class="externo">Dan Morrill</a>. He says he opened the <a href="https://inkscape.org/pt-br/" target="_blank" class="externo">Inkscape</a> (free software for image vectorization) and created his own robot version. The goal was just to personify the system just for your team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            <p>This bizarre first version was even named after its creator: it would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>

            <h2>A new mascot appears</h2>

            <p>The idea of having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. the russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank" class="externo">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, she had the mission to represent the little robot in a more pleasant way.</p>

                <img src="imagens/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Irina Blok, criadora do Bugdroid">
            </picture>

            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The design should also generate quick identification with the person looking at it. Then came the <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, Android's new mascot.</p>

            <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" class="pequena" alt="Bugdroid">

            <p>The main inspiration for the features of the new Bugdroid came from those little figures that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the <strong>Google</strong> and looked towards the restrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.</p>

                <p>Another curious subject regarding Android is that each version has always been named after a candy, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1.5 - <abbr title="Bolo de Copo">Cupcake</abbr></li>
                    <li>1.6 - <abbr title="Rosquinha">Donut</abbr></li>
                    <li>3.0 - <abbr title="Bomba">Eclair</abbr></li>
                    <li>2.2 - <abbr title="Iogurte Congelado">Froyo</abbr></li>
                    <li>2.3 - <abbr title="Biscoito de Gengibre">Gingerbread</abbr></li>

                    <li>4.0 - <abbr title="Sanduíche de Sorvete">Ice Cream Sandwich</abbr></li>
                    <li>4.1 - <abbr title="Jujuba">Jelly Bean</abbr></li>
                    <li>4.4 - <abbr title="KitKat">KitKat</abbr></li>

                    <li>9.0 - <abbr title="Torta">Pie</abbr></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unfortunately, the <strong>Android Q</strong> did not exist, as Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using numbers, which gave rise to Android 10.</p>
                <p>Access the website here <a href="https://www.android.com/intl/en_uk/history/" target="_blank" class="externo">Android History</a>to know the sequence of the "sweetened" versions and what each one brought to the Android system.</p>
